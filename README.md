# Pygame Platformer (2019)

## Backstory

In a world of kangaroos, Mama's joey went missing and she can't find him. She travels the world fighting dingos and hunters, just to get her baby back. 

(PS. if you don't know what a joey is, it is a baby kangaroo) 

## Goal

The goal of this game is to have Mama kangaroo find her joey

## How to play

This game is fairly simple, you:

-Use the right and left arrow keys to move back and forth
 
-Use the space bar to jump and avoid enemies

-Collect strawberries to gain points. If you get hit by an enemy, you do not lose points, you just lose a heart

## Enemy Animation

 Dingos:

 -Dingos are basic enemies

 -There are two dingos you must get past.

 -The dingos can turn and go back and forth

 Hunters:

 -Hunters are platform enemies which means they stay on platforms

 -There are two hunters you must get past. 

 -Hunters just face the same way going back and forth trying to hit you

## Hearts

You have three hearts. Once you run out of hearts, you die. The only way to lose hearts is if you get hit by a dingo or a hunter. It's your job to keep your hearts and finish the game. 

## Title Screen

The title screen starts with an inspirational quote to get you hyped for the game. It is also relaxing due to sunset shown behind the quote. It is the perfect title screen to get you ready to go save a joey.

## Levels

Overall there are four different levels. Each level has a different theme with different backgrounds and songs. As you go through each, be carefull of the surprises you will find. Each level is designed to make finding a loss joey more fun then boring. 

### Level 1

Level 1 is probably easiest level. It starts out in the deserts where you are most likely to find kangaroos.

### Level 2

Level 2 takes place at a swamp. This is all your going to get because I want to keep it a surprise. 

### Level 3

Level 3 takes place in a ghost forest. You hear sad violin music in the background that really makes it creepy.
